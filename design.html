        <h4>Visual Design Elements:</h4>
        <section class="designSubsection">
            <p>For my website, I'm using a Google font known as Quicksand, which gives the site a professional feel while still keeping things approachable thanks to a solid line weight but a lack of sharp edges. I increased the standard font size across the whole website, since I felt that the standard font is too small and hard to read, and is thus an accessibility issue that I needed to solve.</p>
            <h2 class="fontSample">FONT sample</h2>
            <p>
                For my color palette, I have two: A UI palette, which consists of whitesmoke, darkslategray, gray and black, and a page palette, which I use to break the site up into distinctive blocks. This second palette consists of four colors: Aquamarine, Coral, Peachpuff and Lightskyblue. All of these colors are bright enough to give the site some vibrancy, but not so bright as to overwhelm the user. My primary inspiration for doing this was the Comp/Con companion app for the TTRPG Lancer, which is pictured above. Comp/Con is more dynamic with animations and brighter colors, but I liked the idea of using impactful colors to make the site visually appealing. I wanted to make something that is pleasant to look at, without being too minimal or maximal, and the different colors also block out the site really well and make it easy to see where different parts of it begin and end.</p>
                <img src="images/Design/Palette.png" alt="Website Palette">
                <p>
                For the shapes used in my site, I generally stuck with rounded edges, since those make the site less aggressive and feel more personal with their friendlier feel. By doing this, the site can better serve as a portfolio that’s simply meant to be browsed through, rather than something formal that must be used purely to reach a goal before leaving as soon as you are done.
            </p>

            <h4>Implementation notes: </h4>
        <section class="designSubsection"><p>Making this website was very much a learning experience for me. When I started it, I knew nothing about HTML. Now I know a little more, but I’m still learning. The first and most important thing I did learn, however, is to bring over my most important lesson from every other bit of code I’ve ever written: make it scalable. If you look closely at this site and get into the actual HTML of it, you will quickly find that I have reused a lot of CSS and code throughout the site. Because it makes no sense to redo everything every time, especially when you’re trying to make a coherent website with a consistent style.        </p><p>
            Besides the more modular approach I started taking to the website about 1/8th of the way through, the other thing of note I did throughout this phase of the project is I made an awesome piece of code that automatically builds galleries for my pages, using the code from one of our weekly exercises as a starting point. Doing this may have been a little work to set up, but it now means I can very easily and concisely build my galleries in other areas of my site as I need to while just using one script. It’s also a good bit of future proofing, since if I were to ever plug this site into a proper database, I could very easily pull galleries from that in future, which is something I did on the advice of my father who works in IT.
        </p><p>Moving into the second assignment, I've practically been a different designer. I've learnt a lot more about what HTML, JS and CSS can and can't do (not that there's anything they can't do, moreso they aren't great at everything) and more importantly I've become willing to learn from sources outside of Wits. MDN web docs have been hugely useful for this, but in general I've vastly expand my range of sources to deepen my learning and to allow me to build a faster, prettier and -most importantly- more responsive website that functions as intended on a range of devices.
        </p><p>And for the final assignment, I’ve noticed that my early design choices have really come back to haunt me, specifically with microformatting. Microformatting requires a very different design mindset, and I likely would have been able to implement far more of it if I had known to plan around it at the start. The same is true with semantic elements. Ultimately, web development is a space of constant learning, because while the basics are easy to grasp, you could potentially spend a lifetime tweaking a single page, nevermind building a whole site. I do think that I’m a lot better than when I started, but like the home page says, improvement is always, and I still have a long way to go.</p>
        </section>
            
        <h3 class="subheading">IXD Process: </h3>
        <h4>Goal Alignment: </h4>
            <p>Originally this was the simplest area for me, since my goal was to provide a website that can serve as an area to display my work and projects. As such, all I need the user to do is to be able to move around the site as they want to or need to. </p><p>
            However, as the assignment has gone on, my primary purpose for this site has become using it as a portable showcase for my work. That’s why I’ve put a lot of effort into mobile compatibility and why my work is always put first and foremost, because since bringing this site live I have started genuinely using it to show what I’ve done to friends and family, which is hugely useful to me as someone who is often too lackadaisical about showing the amount of work they actually put in on a daily basis.</p><p>
            A point of specific focus for me is the layout of content. The requirements for the site did give me a good starting point with that, but I still tried to lay my information out in a logical hierarchy to make the website easier to navigate. This also helps the user to know what information of mine is the most important, which should let them understand my intentions as the creator a little better and also keep anyone who’s casually using the site focused upon the areas I deem most important.
            </p>
        <h4>Information structure: </h4>
        <section class="designSubsection">
            <img src="images/Design/Sitemap.jpg" alt="Site mapping illustration">
            <p>As mentioned before, I put a focus into this area. A big item of focus for me was my top bar. I wanted to follow a three click rule, which means that any area of my site should either be accessible from the top bar or from a page included in the top bar. This rule helped me to design a website that I think is easy to use, as well as responsive.
            </p>
        </section>
        <h4>User Flow:</h4>
        <section class="designSubsection">
            <p>The website is designed to be easy to navigate, with the points of interaction always being highlighted using a consistent design language and a use of movement to make them stand out. This should make it easier for users to not just navigate my site, but also to utilize the features I’ve implemented, even if most of them are simple and don’t require too much interaction from the user. </p>
        </section>
        
        <h4 class="font">Interface Elements:</h4>
        <p>All my interface elements follow a standardized style, which should make them easier to use and identify. Beyond the buttons to take the user to different parts of my site and the top bar that allows them to navigate the space as a whole, I have also added a hamburger menu to allow ease of navigation with reduced screen size, a footer with some basic functionality and a return to top button that allows the user to quickly return to the top of the page if they need to for any reason. In general, my interface is something I am particularly happy with, since it’s both functional and aesthetically unintrusive, which is the most any user interface can ask for when it is not part of the core experience itself.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Code impact on UI and UX:</h4>
        <section class="designSubsection">
            <p>My UI is heavily code driven now, thanks to my nifty javascript function that populates my top and side bars from an array instead of manually placing them in each page. This lets me very easily make site wide changes without needing to take hours to implement them, making it a very welcome addition. This is definitely the largest change, and I’d say the most impactful, since it means that the experience across my whole site is a lot more unified now, which should make it easier to learn and create a more pleasant experience overall. </p><p>
                Beyond the most important implementations, I’ve got a few others. The galleries and text sections of the site are both populated by Java, allowing me to keep the HTML clean and also to unify my various posts and entries with very little difficulty. Java also powers the useful function that allows me to display entire entries in their own windows, which is a major boon to the cleanliness of the site. The back to top button is also partially driven by Java, although less so than other aspects, and I have a search function that’s really more of a filter function that should hopefully make finding specific entries a little easier, although it’s not the greatest and is probably the part of the website that could use the most improvement.
            </p><p>
                Finally, I believe that UX is affected positively by the code overall. My site is a generally smooth experience to operate, even if there is room for improvement, and the code is a big part of that. Be that in terms of me polishing a lot of the surface level imperfections off through hard trial and error, or just the simple fact that a lot of my implementations make the site better, this site is a long shot from where it started, and I believe it’s a far more pleasant experience because of it. There’s still work to do, don’t get me wrong, but I don’t think any of my coding changes have made the site worse at least.

        <h4>Final Assessment goals and corrections:</h4>
        <section class="designSubsection">
            <div class="designList">
                <p>Going from the version of my website I refer to as 1.5 to this 1.6 version, I have decided to list all my planned design changes and explain as to why I want to make each of them.
                </p><p>Firstly and foremostly, my top priority:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make the site fully mobile compatible: This is both a marks driven and personal goal. I need this site to be mobile compatible for marks, of course, but I would also just personally like it to work on my phone because it would make it a lot easier to show to people, therefore giving me convenient access to a pretty large portfolio of my work wherever I choose to go.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For the goals based on feedback from markers:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Logo: I ran out of time to replace my placeholder logo with something I myself made. So I will be resolving that in this iteration of the site.
                    </li><li>Replace Divs with more semantic elements: While my site has gotten a bit better with semantic elements, I still think there’s a lot of room for improvement (and my marks agreed). So, I plan on doing even more along these lines, hopefully replacing the majority of divs where they aren’t needed.</li>
                    <li>Metadata: Once again, something I ran out of time on. It just missed being high enough on the list of priorities to be put in, but now that I have more time, I can resolve this issue and get things working nicely. This is also a good place to mention I need to fix my usage of H1 elements outside of where they are intended.</li>
                    <li>Micro Formatting: This is going to be one of the more difficult things to add, since I only really learnt about it going into this final assessment, but I am going to try my best to add some microformatting whenever possible. </li>
                    <li>Fix Blog: Apparently I misplaced parts of my blog code somewhere? That should be a simple enough fix, but still an important one.</li>
                    <li>Camelcase: My site needs consistent camel case. This is something that I’m just going to have to check through all my code for, but it should once again be simple enough.</li>
                    <li>Compress images: Some of my images are a little large, so I will need to compress them down so that my site runs better.</li>
                    <li>BR usage: Please have mercy on my BR usage. I am a python coder, I know no better. But yes that said I apparently still have some BR elements hiding in my site, and I will be removing those for the sake of complying with a higher standard.</li>
                    <li>Reference Blog: I need to go through my blog and include some kind of reference to what articles I’m talking about in each entry. I don’t plan on doing a full Harvard reference, but I do agree that I need something that’s enough to let anyone reading it know which articles I am referring to.</li>
                    <li>Event listener: This one is a bit weird to me, because I was marked as though I don’t have one but I’m pretty sure I do? That’s something I’ll have to look into, and for now I’m not really all that sure where I can implement one but I will still try if I see a chance.</li>
                    <li>Use only “Var”: I tried to fix this on my 1.5 draft of the site, but clearly I missed something somewhere so I’ll try and touch that up again.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Personal Goals:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Search Bar: I want to add search functionality to the blog section, and maybe I’ll add it to the essay page as well. It should help with navigation and also gives me a good chance to practice some advanced JS to bolster my skills.</li>\
                    <li>Touch up design section: Due to how much effort went into the technical side of the site, I wasn’t really able to do that much work on my design section. Hopefully I’ll have time to do a bit more now, and I also plan on doing so in a dedicated document editing software so that I have more tools of that variety available to me.</li>
                    <li>UX and UI code relationship: This is something from the new brief I need to add to my design section.</li>
                    <li>Animated Font Samples: I have code for animated font, I just haven’t used it. So I’m planning on utilizing it to show a sample of my font that I use throughout the site in a more dynamic way.</li>
                    <li>Update Wireframes: The site is constantly changing, so doing a new iteration of the wireframes with the addition of user flow annotation should be a good step in showing that constant improvement.</li>
                </ul>
